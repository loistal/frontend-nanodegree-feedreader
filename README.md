# Testing

## What is this?
I used this project in order to showcase my JS testing skills.
Here, the Jasmine (v2.0) library is used.

## How to run
* Clone the repository on your machine (requires git): ```git clone https://github.com/loistal/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader```
* Open ```index.html``` using a web browser (the tests are executed automatically, and the results are visible at the bottom of the page)
